# Sorting Algorithm's Visualizer

Create a web application using HTML, CSS, Javascript to visualize how various sorting algorithms work. This projectâ€™s functionality will be similar to [this](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html) application

### High Level Approach :
1. Creating the website's User Interface (UI) using HTML, CSS and enhancing it further using Bootstrap; without actually implementing any of the app's core features.
1. Implementation of animations, effects and core functionalities (sorting algorithms) using JavaScript.

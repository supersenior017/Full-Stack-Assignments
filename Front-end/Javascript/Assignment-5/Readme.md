# Rock Paper Scissors

## Basic Concept :
So, the basic concept behind this game is to create 3 `buttons`, and attach event listeners to them. Each event listen would have an `id` and is going to trigger a function that handles the RockPaperScissor game logic.

You'll also need to maintain a scoreboard that shows your score and is updated each time you press the button.

 tip : You can add images of rock, paper and scissors and then attach event listers to them directly.

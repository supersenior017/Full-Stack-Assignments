# Tic Tac Toe game

## Basic Concept :
This is another game you can build using `html`, `css` and `javascript`.
This project would not only challenge your CSS skills but also logic building skills with JS.

So, the basic concept behind this game is to create 9 `divs`, align them all within the square using `CSS Flexbox` or `CSS grids`. Once you are done with the layout you need to add event listeners to each element, which triggers the move. On each move you'll need to keep a track of current state of the board, once a player reached winning state you can display the result.


 tip : You can create an array of all winning states, and then compare it to the move array of each user to check wo wins.
